# Identity
Name : Darren Dharmasaputra Kwariawan (1313623024)

# AI usage
I use ChatGPT and also Gemini AI to deepend my understanding about slow convex hull algorithm and helping me to know Qt's library. I used these queries to help me finishing this assignment. The queries :
- "How to make a List in Qt6"
- "How to pair two points in Qt6"
- "Explain to me how this pseudocode works"

# Collaboration usage
I elaborate with some of my friends. We discuss about how the algorithm works and about the output iteration. I discuss with Adhitya, Agastya, Deric, Darrell, Fikri, and Ryan. In the discussion, we found some difference in the output iteration.

# Commit Rules
Use .gitignore to stripe any binaries from the resulting build before commit.  If you cloned directly from the template, you are safe.
